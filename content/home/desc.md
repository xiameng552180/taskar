Most people use physical sticky notes (easy and quick to sketch) and digital software (easy to copy and share) for creating todos and tasks. Switching between physical objects and digital software is tedious, and synchronizing from both ends is even more challenging. Our initial survey (N=153) showed that 75.8% of the participants mixed the use of paper-based physical material and digital software for task management, and 56.2% wanted to combine the benefits of both media. We see AR’s potential in supporting this hybrid approach by recognizing its capability to overlay digital content on physical materials. We propose TaskAR, utilizing AR for better task creation by leveraging the benefits of both physical materials and digital software.
